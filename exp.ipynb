What is Stored Procedure?   \\nAns: A stored procedure is a named group of SQL statements that have been p reviously \\ncreated and stored in the server database.

Stored procedures can \\nbe used to help ensure the integrity of the database.  \\n \\n2). What are the uses of stored procedure?  \\nAns: Stored procedures are often used for dat a validation and as access control mechanism. \\nLogic applied in applications can be centralized and stored in applications.

Can you add constraints to a table that already has data?  \\nYes, But it also depend on data, like if a column containing null values and you adding not \\nnull constraint then first you need to replace all  \\nalues.  \\n \\n4).

What is the difference between Wide and Nonwide tables in SQL Server?  \\nAns: 1) W ide table can contain 30,000 columns, Non -wide table(basic table) can contain \\nonly 1024 columns.  \\n2) Wide Tables are considered to be denormalized tables, Non -wide tables are considered \\nto be Normalized tables.  \\n3) Wide tables are used in OLAP systems, Narro w tables are used in OLTP system.  \\n4) Wide table is new feature in SQL Server 2008.

Maximum  how many rows can be in the SQL Server tables?  \\nAns: According to Microsoft specification:  \\nRows per table: Limited by available storage  \\n \\nBut there are some cases where SQL Server will prevent you from adding more rows  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 If you have an IDENTITY column and yo u hit the end of the range for the data type, \\ne.g. 255 for TINYINT, 2,147,483,647 for INT, some ungodly number th  \\n9 - possibly the number of inches to the sun and back - for BIGINT, etc. When you try to \\ninsert the next row, you'll get error message 815 abo ut overflowing the type.  \\n\\uf0b7 If you have a heap with a non -unique index, or a clustered index that is not unique, \\nyou won't be able to store more than 2 * 2,147,483,647 unique index key \\ncombinations. When you try to insert (2 * 2,147,483,647) + 1 rows with a v alue of 1 in \\nan INT column that is the only column in a clustered index, you will get error \\nmessage 666 about exhausting the uniqueifier. This is because the uniqueifier (which \\nhelps SQL Server identify a row when there is no true key) is only 4 bytes, whi ch \\nmeans it can't exceed the capacity of an INT (it does use both positive and negative, \\nunlike IDENTITY unless configure it as such, which is why you get double). Now why \\nyou would ever do this, <shrug>... but you could.  \\n\\uf0b7 In the VLDB space, a database can only be 524,272 terabytes. Again a very edge case, \\nbut if you have a humongous data warehouse then obviously at some point the \\nnumber of rows - depending on row size - will put you near this limit.  \\n5). What is the maximum size of a varchar(max) variable?  \\nAns: Maximum size for a varchar(max) is 2GB, or looked up a more exact figure (2^31 -1, or \\n2147483647).  \\n \\n6).

How much size “Null” value takes in SQL Server?  \\nAns: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 If the field is fixed width storing NULL takes the same space as any other value - the \\nwidth of the fiel d. \\n\\uf0b7 If the field is variable width the NULL value takes up no space.  \\n10).

You can capture and save data about each event to a \\nfile or SQL Server table to analyze later.  \\n \\n5). What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statement?  \\nAns:  A DELETE statement enables you to selectivel y remove data from a table, whereas  \\nThe TRUNCATE statement unconditionally removes all rows from a table.  \\n \\n6).

What is the difference between a DDL trigger and a DML trigger?  \\nAns: A DDL trigger executes in response to a change to the structure of a database (for \\nexample, CREATE, ALTER, DROP).  \\nA DML trigger executes in response to a change in data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  \\n \\n8). What database does SQL Server use for temporary tables?  \\nAns: TempDB  \\n \\n \\n9). What is a linked server?  \\n \\nAns: A linked server enables you to work with other SQL Servers as wel l as databases other \\nthan SQL Server databases, right from within Management Studio.  \\n \\n10).

What is an active database?  \\nAns: Active database is a database that includes active rules, mostly in the form of ECA \\nrules(Event Condition rules). Active database system s enhance traditional database \\nfunctionality with powerful rule processing cabalities, providing a uniform and efficient \\nmechanism for database system applications  \\n \\n12). What is the difference between a HAVING CLAUSE and a WHERE CLAUSE?  \\nAns: HAVING can be used only with the SELECT statement. HAVING is typically used in a \\nGROUP BY clause. When GROUP BY is not used, HAVING behaves like a WHERE clause. \\nHaving Clause is basically used only with the GROUP BY function in a query whereas WHERE \\nClause is applied to  each row before they are part of the GROUP BY function in a query.  \\n \\n13). What are the purpose of  Normalization?  \\nAns: Minimize redundancy in data.  \\nRemove insert, delete and update anamoly during the database activities.  \\nReduce the need to reorganize data i t is modified or enhanced.  \\nNormalization reduces a complex user view to a set of small and stable subgroups of fields \\nor relations.  \\n \\n14).

What is the difference between a local and a global variable?  \\nAns: A Local temporary table exists only for the duration of a connection or, if defined \\ninside a compound statement, for the duration of the compound statement.   \\nA Global temporary table remains in the database permanently, but the rows exist only \\nwithin a given connection. When conn ection are closed, the data in the global temporary \\ntable disappears. However, the table definition remains with the database for access when \\ndatabase is opened next time.  \\n \\n17). What is NOT NULL Constraint?  \\nAns: A NOT NULL constraint enforces that the colu mn will not accept null values. The not \\nnull constraints are used to enforce domain integrity, as the check constraints.  \\n \\n18). What is log shipping?  \\nAns: Log shipping is the process of automating the backup of database and transaction log \\nfiles on a produc tion SQL server, and then restoring them onto a standby server. Enterprise \\nEditions only supports log shipping. In log shipping the transactional log file from one \\nserver is automatically updated into the backup database on the other server.  \\n \\n19). Define J oins?  \\nAns: A Join combines columns and data from two or more tables (and in rare cases, of one \\ntable with itself).  \\n \\n20). What is Cross Join?  \\nAns: A cross join that does not have a WHERE clause produces the Cartesian product of the \\ntables involved in the jo in. The size of a Cartesian product result set is the number of rows \\nin the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",
